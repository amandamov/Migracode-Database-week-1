To submit this homework write the correct commands for each question here:

When you have finished all of the questions - open a pull request with your answers to the Databases-Homework repository.

Task
Create a new database called cyf_classes (hint: use createdb in the terminal)

Create a new table mentors, for each mentor we want to save their name, how many years they lived in Glasgow, their address and their favourite programming language.

Insert 5 mentors in the mentors table (you can make up the data, it doesn't need to be accurate ;-)).

Create a new table students, for each student we want to save their name, address and if they have graduated from Code Your Future.

Insert 10 students in the students table.

Verify that the data you created for mentors and students are correctly stored in their respective tables (hint: use a select SQL statement).

Create a new classes table to record the following information:

A class has a leading mentor
A class has a topic (such as Javascript, NodeJS)
A class is taught at a specific date and at a specific location
Insert a few classes in the classes table

We now want to store who among the students attends a specific class. How would you store that? Come up with a solution and insert some data if you model this as a new table.

Answer the following questions using a select SQL statement:

Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
Retrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript
Retrieve all the students who are CYF graduates
Retrieve all the classes taught before June this year
Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the classes table).
